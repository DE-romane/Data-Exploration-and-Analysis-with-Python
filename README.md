# Boston Crime Data Analysis Project

Welcome to our Boston Crime Data Analysis Project! This initiative aims to explore and analyze crime data from Boston to uncover patterns and insights that can enhance public safety strategies. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset from the Boston Police Department, we seek to dissect the frequency, distribution, and nature of reported crimes across various districts in the city.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Import and clean the raw crime data to prepare it for detailed analysis.
- **Trend Analysis:** Examine crime trends over time by aggregating the number of crimes per month and visualizing these trends to identify seasonal patterns or anomalies.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Identify crime hotspots and distribution across different districts in Boston.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide findings that can inform law enforcement on resource allocation and strategic planning to enhance public safety.
